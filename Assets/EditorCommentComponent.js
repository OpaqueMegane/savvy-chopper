/*
This is a custom Editor script that lets you add comments/notes to components in the Unity Editor.

Place this script in Assets/Editor

Place EditorCommentComponent with your other normal scripts.

To comment an Object, simply attach an EditorCommentComponent to the object, and type away in the text box.

If you're a super good person, you could even create an empty game object called "_README" in your scene, and then put a comment on that sucker.
Comments for the scene!
